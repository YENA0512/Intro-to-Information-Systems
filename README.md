## Final Report _ House Market Today (HMT)


INTRODUCTION:  

The housing market is a booming business which is constantly growing and the need for information is important. The only thing is due to the amount of information out there about housing and on the different websites, we took it upon ourselves to think of ways to make life easier for the average user who is interested in the housing market. One of the first things we did was to try and assess the different housing websites such as Relator, Zillow, and redfin. Our aim in doing so was to figure out ways in which we can look at already established websites and find their weaknesses. Once we have done that we look for solutions in which we can improve the way the information is displayed to the average user and from there add our unique way of doing things which will hopefully make life better for the users who are interested in purchasing housing.  

In our report, we will go into our plan for how we want to implement our proposed system. This will include the analysis of the current solutions available and how we plan to improve on them in a unique product. We will go over the specific features that we wish to implement in our system which will vary with each type of user. Furthermore, we will talk about the resources we need to actually implement the system like databases, servers, or the amount of cloud space. Next, we will go over our project plan containing various sequential phases for implementing the system. This will include analysis, design, development, and deployment. Lastly, we will talk about potential challenges moving forward in addition to some important details that we would like to highlight about our system.
